<h1>Easy Fluffy Pancakes Recipe</h1>
<h3>Prep: 10 Minutes Cook: 20 Minutes Total: 30 Minutes</h3>


<h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 and 1/2 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons Sugar</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Baking Powder</li>
    <li>1/2 Teaspoon Table Salt</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 Cups Milk</li>
    <li>1 Large Egg</li>
    <li>5 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>2 Teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Melt the butter and set it aside to cool</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, 
    and vanilla extract. Do not worry if the butter solidifies a little.</li>
<li>Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour the milk mixture into the well and 
    gently whisk until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are perfectly normal. 
    As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be thick, like cake batter. 
    If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.</li>
<li>Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. To check if it is ready, sprinkle 
    a few drops of water on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.</li>
<li>Brush the skillet with melted butter for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan).
     Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop, then gently spread 
     each pancake into a 4-inch circle.</li>
     <li>After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip 
        the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they are lightly browned and cooked 
        through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm syrup, more butter, and berries.</li>
</ol>
