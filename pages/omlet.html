<h3>Preparing Fillings</h3>
<h4>Vegetable</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Dice 1 cup of vegetables.</li>
    <li>Over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 
        minutes depending on the vegetables you choose. Set aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3></h3>
<h4>Bacon/Sausage</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cook bacon (or sausage), garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked 
        and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). Whisk in salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Once they begin to 
        set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked 
        eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.</li>
    <li>Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette.</li>
    <li>Then, add the toppings on one half of the omelette, and fold the other half over the toppings.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
